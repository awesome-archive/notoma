# Using the CLI

Getting started with the CLI tool. This notebook also moonlights as an integration test, as actually runs the example commands.

## Convert

Converts the Notion blog database to a bunch of markdown files in a specified directory.

Despite `--from` and `--token_v2` options are not requreired in the CI help output, you must provide them in the command line, or in the `.env` config file.

If you try running `notoma convert` without providing them, notoma will fail with an error message asking for these options.
